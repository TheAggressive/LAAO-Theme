/**
 * Type the `core/block-editor` store so `select( blockEditorStore )` resolves
 * real selector signatures instead of `unknown`.
 *
 * Why this is needed: `@wordpress/data` ships its own types, and its
 * `CurriedSelectorsOf<S>` only resolves selectors when the store descriptor
 * carries a `ReduxStoreConfig` with a `Selectors` type. `@wordpress/block-editor`
 * ships no types of its own, so the descriptor comes from
 * `@types/wordpress__block-editor`, which extends `StoreDescriptor` with the
 * default `AnyConfig`. Inference then falls through and every selector is
 * `unknown`. Merging a typed `instantiate` into the descriptor supplies the
 * config that inference needs.
 *
 * Selectors are declared in their REGISTERED form — with the leading `state`
 * argument — because `CurriedState` strips that first parameter to produce the
 * public signature. Declaring them pre-curried would shift every argument.
 *
 * Only the selectors this theme actually calls are declared. Add to this list
 * rather than widening it; each entry is a deliberate contract.
